## 🏗️ JeriCraft Region Management Commands 🛡️

### 🎯 Introduction
Welcome to the JeriCraft Region Management tutorial! 📚 Protecting your builds and managing access to specific areas is
essential for a seamless and enjoyable experience on our server. 💻 In this guide, we'll cover the necessary commands to
help you effectively manage your regions and collaborate with others. 🤝

## 🔺 Defining Corners

To create a region, you must first define its corners. 🌟 Stand at one corner and enter the `/pos1` command. Then, move
to the opposite corner and enter `/pos2`. This will mark the boundaries of your desired protected area. 🔲

## 🗺️ Expanding Regions

Use the expand command to adjust your region vertically:

`expand <vert|<amount> <amount> [reverseAmount] [direction]`

Specify vert to expand vertically.

Include `<amount>` to set the number of blocks to expand. Negative values expand downwards.
Optionally, use `[reverseAmount]` to expand in the opposite direction.

- Use `[direction]` to expand in a specific direction: north, east, south, or west.

Example: `expand vert 10` will expand your region upwards by 10 blocks. 📏

## 🔐 Claiming and Removing Regions

- To claim a region, use `rg claim <rg name>`. Replace `<rg name>` with your desired region name. 🚩
- To remove a region, enter `rg remove <rg name>`. 🔙

## 🌟 Max Claim Volume
Please note that JeriCraft has a maximum claim volume limit to ensure fair and balanced gameplay for all players. This setting determines the maximum number of blocks you can claim within a region using the self-serve claiming feature, set at 1,000,000 (1 million blocks) per region.

Regions in JeriCraft are cuboid-shaped, meaning they have six rectangular faces. To give you an idea of the possible dimensions for a cuboid region with a volume of 1,000,000 (1 million blocks) blocks, here are a few examples:
- **1000 x 1000 x 1:** A thin, flat region.
- **100 x 100 x 100:** A perfectly cubic region.
- **500 x 500 x 4:** A relatively large, yet shallow, region.
- **1000 x 500 x 2:** A large, flat region.
- **200 x 200 x 25:** A tall, thin region.
- **100 x 100 x 1000:** A very tall, thin region.

Feel free to choose any dimensions for your region as long as the total volume doesn't exceed 1,000,000 blocks. This allows for flexibility in creating regions that cater to your specific needs and preferences within the server's constraints.

If you have any questions or concerns about the max claim volume on JeriCraft or need help determining the best dimensions for your region, don't hesitate to reach out to our friendly community or server staff for assistance. Happy building!

## 📖 Displaying Region Information

- Enter `rg i` to view information about the region you're standing in. 📚

## 📝 Listing Owned Regions

- Use `rg list` to display a list of all regions you own. 🗂️

## 👥 Adding and Removing Members and Owners

- To add a member to a region, enter `rg addmember <rg name> <player>`. 👪
- To remove a member, use `rg removemember <rg name> <player>`. 😔
- Add an owner to a region with `rg addowner <rg name> <player>`. 🤴
- Remove an owner using `r`g removeowner <rg name> <player>`. 👑

## 🔮 Setting Region Flags

Customize region settings using `rg flag <rg name> <flag> <value>`. Replace `<flag>` with the desired setting
and `<value>` with the appropriate parameter.

Example: `rg flag myregion mob-spawning deny` will prevent mobs from spawning in the region named "myregion." 🚫

For a list of available region flags, refer to the [Region Flags section](../features/Main.md#worldguard) in the Main
documentation.
